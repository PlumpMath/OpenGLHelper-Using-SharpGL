Steps to take when adding a new shader (Visual Studio 2013 Ultimate):

1) Create the fragment and vertex shaders
	NOTE:	Inside Shaders/ShaderProperties.resx
			- Put all shader files under the ShaderPath directory;
			- Use the preset extensions for each shader file;
			- Remember to set the file "Build Action" to "Embedded Resource" (You can this in "Properties" while selecting the file)

2) Create a parameters class that implements the necessary ParameterInterfaces.
	IF		Your required features aren't available yet
			- Add a new interface that's implementing the ID to call this functionality.
			- Add a "Apply..."-method to ExtShaderProgram to provide a general place for users to apply this shader.
			WHY?		Because I don't like meaningless strings in my code, and I like scalability and prevent double code.
			CONTRIBUTE: if you need additional features and decide to implement your own interface. Please consider sharing it.

3) Add a "Load..."-method to Scene/Shaders, to easely choose your shader.
4) Use shader :)
